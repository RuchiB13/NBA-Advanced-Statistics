An Analytical Approach to Cost-Effective Team Formation Using Hierarchical Clustering and Regression


Achieving a well-rounded team is often easy for already successful and “rich” teams given their power and resources. However, a majority of teams are less successful in comparison to the top teams.We devised a model that is capable of generating teams given a salary cap using linear regression and a method of capturing a set of player’s total win potential given their advanced statistics. To preface our initial goal, we also performed hierarchical clustering to determine if a player’s success and performance is attributed to his advanced statistics. Our metrics show that the teams formed are well within a budget and are viable teams based on historical performance.
